# Problem Statement:
- Create a small CRUD application. Where user can login, see product list, and upon clicking will be redirected to product detail page.
- Admin will have ability to add product.


# How test: 
- Ensure that you have Node js version > 18.0.0 installed.
- Download Expo Go in your phone / simulator. 
- Go to project directory, type "npm install"or "npm install --force" to install dependencies.
- Run "npm start"
- In your terminal, a barcode will be shown, scan it using your Android's Expo go, or if you are using iOS, you can use your camera app. If you want to use web-version, simply click w. 


# Tech used:
- React Native
- Expo Go


# Things to consider:
- This has to be run with separate API that and be run on same machine / IP.
- The application is tested on Android real device and web browser (haven't gotten chance to test it on iOS simulator). 


# Future improvement:
- Add more features and screens.
- Better coverage at tests.
- Overall UI/UX.
